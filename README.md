# Group Habit Tracking App Read Me üì±

Welcome to our group habit tracking app repository! This Read Me provides an overview of our project, its purpose, features, and how to set it up for development or production use.

## Overview

Our application is a group habit tracking platform designed for Android devices, with Firebase as the backend platform. Through this app, users can share groups, habits, and rewards they obtain collectively.

The primary aim of the app is to assist users in overcoming addictions and establishing positive habits through a common support environment. Group members must individually confirm the completion of shared habits to mark the day as complete using fingerprint authentication and, in some cases, location verification to demonstrate attendance at events such as the gym, classes, or library. This fosters accountability and collective motivation.

Users can join thematic groups focused on various areas of personal improvement, such as quitting smoking, exercising regularly, or practicing meditation. Each group provides a virtual space to share progress, challenges, and strategies to overcome difficulties. Using a user-friendly interface, members can set personal habit goals and track the progress of other group members.


## Why GPL? üìù

The GPL (GNU General Public License) is a popular choice for open-source projects like ours for several reasons:

**Protects Freedom:** The GPL ensures that users have the freedom to use, study, modify, and distribute the software. This aligns with our ethos of promoting accessibility and empowerment through technology.

**Community Collaboration:** By using the GPL, we encourage collaboration within the community. Anyone can contribute to the project, leading to faster development and innovation. This fosters a sense of shared ownership and collective progress toward our goals.
